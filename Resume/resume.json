Over 70% of the apps I developed were featured on the AppStore including titles like NYTimes, ESPN ScoreCenter, Audible and ANZ.  Under my direction, Atimi has stayed in a sweet spot on the technology curve.  We advised clients to avoid premature adoption and to design based on what’s best for customers and their brand by leveraging strengths of each platform, be it iOS, Android, Windows or web.  Besides architecture and coding, I am often hired to mentor  and advise on how to create long term strategies, including hiring developers who are capable of keeping up the quality bar set out by my initial development work. As the most senior developer at Atimi for the last 10 years I was instrumental in Atimi being accepted as one of only a handful of small service companies in the Apple Mobility Partnership Program (https://www.apple.com/ca/business/partners/)."}},
