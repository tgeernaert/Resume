We advised clients to avoid premature adoption and to design based on what’s best for customers and their brand by leveraging strengths of each platform, be it iOS, Android, Windows or web.  Besides architecture and coding, I am often hired to mentor  and advise on how to create long term strategies, including hiring developers who are capable of keeping up the quality bar set out by my initial development work.
